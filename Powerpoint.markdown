## Powerpoint

Powerpoint is a Microsoft tool used to create slide-based presentations.

It is *not recommended* to use Powerpoint. The text in Powerpoint files can
sometimes be easily converted into accessible electronic formats. But the
mathematical content cannot be easily converted. Powerpoint converts
mathematical content into images without description or alt text. Currently
there is no way to convert a Powerpoint file into another file format that
preserves accessible description of the mathematical content.

Powerpoint users must be prepared to manually extract all the content (both
narrative and mathematical) and place it in a file format usable by their
Disability Services office.
